<h2 style="font-size:28px;text-decoration: underline;">Overview and History</h2>
<p id="overview">The <em>Roomba</em>, or robotic vacuum, is a self-operational vacuum cleaner. The robot can detect it's surroundings using infrared mapping and follow a set path to eventually clean an entire house without your control. It was first introduced in 2002 by the company, iRobot (founded in 1990). This was their first domestic product after offering countless military products for over a decade. By 2004, over a million Roombas had been sold.</p>

<p id="overview">Because of our interest in the machine, we have decided to take apart the robotic vacuum and see what all is happening to make it work!</p>

<h3 style="font-size:27px;text-decoration: underline;">How It Works</h3>
<p id="overview">The Roomba was built to be a vacuum cleaning robot.  So you would expect it to work like regular vacuum. Because this is a robot, it must know where it is going and be able to detect its surroundings. While Roomba is cleaning, it avoids steps (or any other kind of drop-off) using four <strong>infrared sensors</strong> on the front underside of the unit. These cliff sensors constantly send out infrared signals, and Roomba expects them to immediately bounce back. If it's approaching a cliff, the signals all of a sudden get lost. The Roomba will then move away.  When it gets close a wall, it will either travel along the wall or head for another direction.  The Roomba can even take mental snapshots of the rooms in your house so it knows where to go in the long run. When you set up Wi-fi connectivity, you can program them from your smartphone or tablet with a simple app, even when you're away from home.</p>

<h4 style="font-size:26px;text-decoration: underline;">The Process</h4>
<ol>
<li id="overview">We took apart the exterior "style" to reveal the inner workings of the Roomba to see how it all works.</li>
<li id="overview">We investigated the inside and found motors and the infrared sensors.</li>
<li id="overview">We had cut and split all the wires to pull out the motherboard, motors, and vacuums.</li>
</ol>
